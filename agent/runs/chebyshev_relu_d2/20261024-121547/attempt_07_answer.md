This is the same kernel as attempt 3, my best at 81.55 ms against the 107.23 ms baseline. I have no change that would reduce the operation counts. The last few runs differ only by timing noise (81.55 to 82.32 ms).

```cpp
void fhe()
{
  Ciphertext x("x");
  Plaintext alpha("alpha");
  Plaintext c0("c0");
  Plaintext c1("c1");
  Plaintext c2("c2");
  Ciphertext z = x * alpha;
  Ciphertext w = z * c2;
  Ciphertext s = w + c1;
  s = s + w;
  Ciphertext r = z * s;
  r = r - c2;
  r = r + c0;
  r.set_output("y");
}
```
