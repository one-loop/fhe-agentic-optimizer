# extract_linear: LLM optimization run 20261108-214944

Model `claude-opus-5-5` (effort medium), 8 attempts, wall time 147 s, approximate API cost $0.0000.

| | fhe() time (ms) | levels | (depth, mult. depth) | ct-ct mul | ct-pt mul | rotations | max error |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | 4.75 | 1 | (2, 1) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4.8e-06 |
| best (attempt 0) | 4.75 | 1 | (2, 1) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 4.8e-06 |

Speedup: x1.00 (baseline and best re-scored as in score.py: 10 interleaved processes each; 1.00 when no candidate was confirmed faster).
