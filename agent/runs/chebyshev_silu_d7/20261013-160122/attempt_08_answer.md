I'm submitting the same kernel again. Attempt 7 measured 214.34 ms, which matches attempt 2's 214.25 ms within noise, so this structure is stable at about 214 ms against the 303 ms baseline.

It uses three ciphertext multiplies, the minimum for a degree-6 polynomial, and four plaintext multiplies, with depth 4. I don't have a restructuring I'm confident would beat this, so I'm not spending the last attempt on a speculative change.

```cpp
void fhe()
{
  Ciphertext x("x");
  Plaintext alpha("alpha");
  Ciphertext z = x * alpha;
  Plaintext one("one");

  // T2 = 2 z^2 - 1
  Ciphertext z2 = z * z;
  Ciphertext T2 = z2 + z2 - one;

  // T4 = 2 T2^2 - 1
  Ciphertext q = T2 * T2;
  Ciphertext T4 = q + q - one;

  // c6*T6 + c4*T4 = T4 * (2 c6 T2 + c4) - c6 T2
  Plaintext c6("c6");
  Plaintext c4("c4");
  Ciphertext v = T2 * c6;
  Ciphertext u = v + v + c4;
  Ciphertext m = T4 * u;

  Plaintext c2("c2");
  Ciphertext w = T2 * c2;
  Ciphertext wv = w - v;

  Plaintext c1("c1");
  Ciphertext term1 = z * c1;

  Ciphertext result = wv + term1;
  result = result + m;
  Plaintext c0("c0");
  result = result + c0;
  result.set_output("y");
}
```
