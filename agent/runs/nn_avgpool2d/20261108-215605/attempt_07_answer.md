No cheaper circuit exists, for the same reasons as before. Each of the 9 outputs sums 4 inputs that no other output uses, so 27 additions is the minimum. There are no multiplications or rotations to remove, and both possible depths (2 and 3) have been tried. Any other circuit would add operations and run slower.

The baseline remains the final answer. Here it is again; it will be reported as identical to the baseline.

```cpp
void fhe()
{
  const size_t in_h = WIDTH, in_w = WIDTH;
  const size_t stride = 2;
  const size_t out_h = in_h / stride;
  const size_t out_w = in_w / stride;

  vector<vector<Ciphertext>> x(in_h, vector<Ciphertext>(in_w));
  for (size_t r = 0; r < in_h; ++r)
    for (size_t c = 0; c < in_w; ++c)
      x[r][c] = Ciphertext("x_" + to_string(r) + "_" + to_string(c));

  for (size_t r = 0; r < out_h; ++r)
  {
    for (size_t c = 0; c < out_w; ++c)
    {
      Ciphertext patch_sum = x[r * stride][c * stride];
      patch_sum += x[r * stride][c * stride + 1];
      patch_sum += x[r * stride + 1][c * stride];
      patch_sum += x[r * stride + 1][c * stride + 1];
      patch_sum.set_output("y_" + to_string(r) + "_" + to_string(c));
    }
  }
}
```
